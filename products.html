<p class="em-wide" id="portraitedge">PORTR<b>AI</b>T <b>EDGE</b></p><br> This software tool is purpose-built for heterogenous data ingestion and management. We recognise that asset value can be better quantified by fusing information from multiple sources, coming in at different rates. This includes system or component videos and images, environmental and atmospheric conditions, maintenance logs and part replacements, and sensor / performance data. Not only does this tool serve as a foundational building block for Fleet-wide analysis, but it is useful in its own right to technicians, MROs, OEMs, consultants and lessors.<br>
<br>
<p class="em-wide" id="portraitfleet">PORTR<b>AI</b>T <b>FLEET</b></p><br>This software tool comes in a fully customisable interface. It generates fleet-wide hierarchical models that offer more precise and accurate remaining useful life estimates, scrap rate values, and maintenance work scope planning guidance. Underneath the hood it exploits the shared experiences of different assets of the same family to inform more rigorous quantitative estimates. <br>
<br>
<p class="em-wide" id="portraitledger">PORTR<b>AI</b>T <b>LEDGER</b></p><br> Ledger represents our tools for assisting companies working focused on incorporating blockchain technologies within their asset maintenance and workscope ecosystem.<br><br>

<p class="em-wide" id="portraitworkshops">PORTR<b>AI</b>T <b>WORKSHOP</b></p><br> The Workshop is a two-day service which uses our core IP engine as well as consultancy services included to support and get the output required to solve the particular challenge. The output is a bespoke digital twin which can be based on existing digital twins or be a new model, as well as incorporating disparate and new heterogeneous data. The workshop is split over two days: <br><br>
<b> Day 1 </b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Inputs and outputs: Help define the challenge and required scope of the solution. Validate the data required and available, and any previous models and digital twins.</li>
<li>Configure and Tune: Upload the data and generate the model. Validate the model and demonstrate efficacy and uncertainty quantification.</li>
</ul>
<b> Day 2 </b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret and Solve: Examine the outputs and validate the solution to show efficacy. Iterate as required. Hand over model to be usable going forward
</li>
</ul>
