<br>
Pranay Seshadri is the Founder and Head of Engineering of Portrait Technology. He has a background in aeroengine design, manufacturing and maintenance, having worked very closely with <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com">Rolls-Royce plc</a> for over 10 years on numerous projects. He is concurrently a Research Fellow in the Statistics Section of the Department of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a>.
<br>
<br>
In 2016 he founded the widely-used open-source <a href="https://equadratures.org">equadratures</a> project. This code is now routinely used in multiple industries, academia and research labs. In a nutshell, it builds polynomial-based surrogate models that are used for uncertainty quantification, trust-region optimisation, data-driven dimension reduction, and data interpretation.
<br>
<br>
In 2018, he joined the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk">Alan Turing Institute</a> as the Group Leader in Aeronautics, leading a multi-disciplinary team of computational fluid dynamics, compressor aerodynamics, and machine learning specialists. During this time, he was the PI of the Digital Twins in Aeronautics project, funded through the AI for Science and Government scheme.
<br>
<br>
He obtained his PhD in Engineering, with a focus on turbomachinery aerodynamics and computational engineering, from the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a> in 2016.
